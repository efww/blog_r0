# Sample Digital Garden Note

This is a sample note to demonstrate how the digital garden works. Digital gardens are a way to cultivate and share your ideas in public.

## What is a Digital Garden?

A digital garden is a collection of notes, essays, and ideas that are constantly evolving. Unlike traditional blogs, digital gardens don't have to be polished or complete.

### Key Characteristics

- **Work in progress**: Notes can be incomplete and evolve over time
- **Non-linear**: Content doesn't have to follow a chronological order
- **Interconnected**: Notes link to each other, creating a network of ideas

## Why Keep a Digital Garden?

Digital gardens are great for:

1. **Learning in public**: Share what you're learning as you learn it
2. **Building connections**: Connect ideas across different domains
3. **Getting feedback**: Get input from others on your ideas

## Code Example

Here's a simple code example:

```javascript
// A simple function to greet someone
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet('Digital Gardener'));
```

## Conclusion

Digital gardens are a great way to share your thinking and learning process with others. They encourage continuous learning and iteration rather than pursuing perfection.
